## Setup
- To install, clone this project and run `cmake -S . -B build` followed by `cmake --build build`.
- Inside the `build` directory, you will find the executable, named `chipcraft`.

## Usage

For now, `chipcraft` is run from the terminal, and only has one option. Usage is as follows:
```bash
chipcraft <file_name>
```

## Specification
Currently only the basic CHIP-8 is supported. Support for SUPER-CHIP and XO-CHIP is planned, as well as stepping and debugging. A better GUI for the emulator is also in the works!

## Tests
A better test suite is in progress so that opcodes can be accurately checked.
